    "homeContent": "<p>Welcome to this place for body-oriented psychotherapy. My name is Sandra, I have been studying body-oriented work since 2017, I graduated from the Bodymind Institute in early 2024 and I have been giving sessions for over 3 years.</p>",
    "aboutContent": "<p>Years of unexplained stomach complaints were the reason for me to delve deeper into the relationship between body and mind. Bodywork in particular has taught me to see how emotions, thoughts and tensions get stuck in my body. I have learned ways to deal with this differently and I now feel more alive and connected. From 2017 to 2020, I attended various longer personal leadership training courses at the former Venwoude Levensschool in which body work and emotion work formed a central part. I then followed the 4-year Integrated Psychotherapy study at Bodymind Institute. I also work with pleasure and amazement as an outpatient support worker. I graduated as an anthropologist in 2015.<br><br>I see every person as unique, and at the same time I see that we all deal with variations of the same human themes. For me, being human is about allowing everything to be there: from sadness, anger and fear to playfulness, happiness and joy. That there is room to make your dreams come true, but that you also develop the resilience to deal with tensions, discomfort and problems, since life does not always go the way we would like.<br><br>I see bodywork as an opportunity to give all parts of ourselves a place, so that they can work together for a life that fulfills us.<br><br>I also like to be influenced by psychoanalytic theories and insights because they provide a lot of knowledge about the problems within and between people and therefore form a basis on which much therapeutic work is based.</p>",
    "methodOneSubtitle": "What is body-oriented psychotherapy?",
    "methodOneContent": "<p>Talking, or verbalizing, is an important way to give words to thoughts or feelings and to gain insight in yourself. However, talking can also be a way of the mind to avoid having to feel what is actually going on. Many people find emotions such as sadness, fear or anger difficult to experience. Others withhold their happiness and find it difficult to share joy or have fun with others.<br><br>It is important to express whatever is happening inside you, especially on an emotional level. Otherwise your energy will stagnate, you will feel frustrated and unhappy, and you may develop all kinds of (physical) complaints.<br><br>Your body offers an entrance to your inner world. Body signals such as breathing, heartbeat or physical sensations provide information about how you are doing. By becoming aware of these signals, you can get to know yourself, in what doesn’t feel good as well as in what makes you happy.<br><br>In sessions you are invited to focus on your physical experience. By verbalizing this experience you gain insights that help you interpret and integrate your experience.<br><br>I use different body-oriented methods, such as bio-energetics, meditations, psychodrama, gestalt and breathwork.</p>",
